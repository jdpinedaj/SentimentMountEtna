"East side of the sicilian island, in the Catania area there is tje volcano. Her majesty ETNA. Enjoy the today pictures. ",EtnaðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
"August 2008. Arrived at Refugio Sapienza just after 9. Make sure you allow plenty of time to get there - the mountain road can take longer than you think (it took us an hour and twenty from Taormina). The long trek was leaving at 10.30 which we didn't expect but it gave us plenty of time to look around at the gift shops - which were just opening - and the fantastic views (you're about 3,000 feet up at this point already) and have a drink. The Etna guides hut is easy to spot and is on the left near the road as you face the cable car station. The long trek is â‚¬60 each and includes the hire of walking boots and a jacket if you don`t have them. You will also need to bring something to tie around your face such as a scarf or t-shirt as the sulphur fumes at the summit can be quite overpowering and acidic. We met up back at the hut at around 10.15 got kitted up and were herded to the cable car station for the first part of the trip. At the top it was over to the big 4x4 jeeps for the next stage. At the end of the jeep journey there is a large high crater to one side which the short trekkers visit, but we headed off towards the summit, first splitting into three groups depending on your language (Italian, French or English). Now here's a warning you should heed: this is not a walk in the park, it's a hard slog. I am not unfit, but I had trouble keeping up with the guide and I wasn't the only one. In fact one of our group dropped out after twenty minutes and went back to the jeep station. There are notices warning asthma sufferers and those with heart conditions not to try it, but that doesn`t really tell you what you`re in for. You also need to be aware that you will be walking up steep slopes and over very loose, uneven ground and you really don't want to fall over onto the sharp volcanic stones. If you're still determined to make the trip then your efforts will be rewarded by the views over Sicily and more importantly the chance to peer into Etna's fume-filled main crater. It's really quite eerie standing at the top and looking down into the swirling sulphur. The crater is very wide and deep making it all the more impressive. You'll also see - and smell - plenty of gas issuing from other points above, below and around you and you'll certainly appreciate that scarf around your face. After about half an hour we headed back roughly the way we came which included an exhilarating run down the side which was a bit like going down a sand dune but one that was made out of volcanic ash. Back at the top jeep station we had our lunch (down at the guide's hut I noticed they were selling packed lunches - â‚¬5, I think - but we'd brought our own) It was high summer and not that cold, even high up. With all the walking I ended up carrying my jacket more than wearing it, but by the time we got back for lunch the cloud had rolled in and that made all the difference; it was very chilly then and you needed something warm to wear. About half of our group - even the younger ones - had had enough by now and decided to take the jeep and cable car back down; this cost another â‚¬17 each, so be warned. The rest of us set off on a different route which brought us fantastic views of the huge Valle del Bove. It was about here that the day took an odd turn (no pun intended) when the guide veered off down another steep ash slope which a couple of people in our group found a bit daunting and so went down it quite slowly. He (the guide) clearly didn't like this and complained about slow people who shouldn't be on this trek. I ( who wasn't one of the slow ones I should add) told him that he was going too fast and anyway running off the path down a 45 degree slope was not my definition of a `trek` (it was fun though, but I didn't tell him that!). He continued to grumble all the way back to the car park and by then he had no doubts about what I thought of him. The annoying thing was that we were told before we set off that we would be back between 4 and 4.30 - we got back at 4.15, so what was his problem? Judging by the fact that he changed into his motorcycling gear pretty quick when we got back, a prior engagement was possibly the answer. All in all it was a great experience and one I'd recommend. Can't say I liked the guide though; if there really was a problem then I'm sure it can't be the first time and someone needs to make it quite clear to potential trekkers what they can expect to face before taking their money.","A hard climb, but worth it"
"Mount Etna is extraordinary. It is an active volcano and has some of the most beautiful landscape you will ever see. There are many ways to get to your destination. There rail cars to go part of the way as well as buses, off-road buses, and private tours.,I normally do not recommend private tours, as I like do you have to do what I want when I want. Because this area was unfamiliar to me and I had never been I thought it best to take a private tour with the family and it was an excellent, decision.,The area is magnificent and you will never see anything like it. The locals as well as a tourist are ever so friendly and will help guide you. This is not a trip I would take if I was unwell, I suggest it for people who are relatively healthy. There is just so much to do it's so much fun to be had that I cannot recommend it we're highly. Have the most magnificent time.",You must see an active volcano at least once in your life.
How much does the cable car cost from Rifugio Sapienza?  We were just charged 60 Euros each (120 for two).  We did not really look at our receipt until we were back in the car.  Most entries on this blog say the cost is 30 Euros; but a few others say 60 per person also.  Is it possible that we and they are being overcharged?,Cost of cable car to the top???
"It's always a great and sensational emotion to come on Etna Volcano. I like to arrive in the top from Nicolosi, for Expert in Cycling: Alberto Contador Side. Natural relaxing",Wonderful Etna
"This is a today picture of the Etna Volcano. Wonderful to see it with a 'white color', in every season is magic! ",EtnaðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
"We visited Etna with two small children in August, but without using a company - so did no get to see all the sights on the mountain.  However, a great drive up (once you are out of the Catania outskirts + c. 1 hr from just outside the city), through lava fields near the top - and car parking is only â‚¬1/day.  Well orgainised at the base level - and cable car gets you quite high up the mountain - and then 4WD buses to near the summit; we did not do the last part (takes an extra 1.5 hrs round trip), but you can walk up the road and across lava/pyroclasts and then get panninis etc + hot drinks (needed) at the cable car station.  Key point, even if it's 40 degrees at sea level it is cold and windy even at the first level - so take sweaters and long trousers at the v. least (and they do have coats available as well at the upper cable car stop).  Great experience and worth doing.","Well orgainised, easy access"
We were able to experience Mt Etna without spending money on a tour. IF you do your research before going you can save yourselves plenty of euros. We left Catania and returned for a total of â‚¬6.60. It was a great experience making our way to the top via the cable car and jeep. Worth the expense if you want to get to the top! ,Cheap and easy way to do Mt Etna
We would like to visit Etna. We have a 3 year old and 9 month old. Does anyone know if you can take children that young on the cable car? And a buggy? Thank you!,Question about Etna Cable Cars and children
"Mount Etna is a stunning day out from Catania. We took the AST bus from Catania to about 1900m followed by a cable car to 2500m and a trek to 2950m. Etna itself is 6 stars out of 5 and that's unheard of. The deductions are for the bus trip and the price of the cable car.,The AST bus is very convenient if you get it at 8.15. Arrive early to get a ticket and get on the bus as soon as you buy your ticket. They seem to continue selling tickets at the ticket office after the first bus is sold out. If there's no space on the first bus you then have to wait til the next bus at 11. This will not give you enough time at Etna. Our bus was oversold and there was a standoff between the disgruntled customers and the bus driver before we could leave Catania.,The bus trip was a bit of a pain. The guide spent the trip trying to sell the guided tour from the top. He was very repetitive and loud so it was difficult to enjoy the bus ride. It may have been a cultural thing but I found his behavior towards some girls on the bus to be over familiar. The bus stop at the halfway mark is very useful for picking up food and water. It's a lot cheaper filling up here rather than at Etna. There are other choices other than the bar the guide directs you to.,When we finally got off the bus it was a relief to be away from the guide. Around the Refugio is very chaotic. The cable car trip was very expensive but we passed above others who chose to walk and we were definitely relieved not to have to hike below the cable car in the heat. The hike from 1900 to 2500m looks like a real struggle.,The cable car dropped us off at 2500m and we walked to the two craters at 2950m. This was a tough steep hike but the air is cool and the views are other worldly. The craters were stunning and it's quite easy to walk all the way around them once you reach them. We've never seen anything like the views before. This, and the views of smoke billowing from the highest crater, made the painful bus trip, ripoff cable car and difficult hike worthwhile.,I think this option works out as the best way to experience Etna if you're on a budget. I would skip paying the large extra fee for a 4WD or the trip to the summit with a guide unless you're really into volcanoes and eruptions. If you don't take the cable car brace yourself for an endurance test and a likely frustrated argument half way up.,In summary,if you visit Sicily definitely go to Etna. If you're lucky enough to have your own transport count your blessings that you'll avoid the guide on the AST bus. Otherwise ASTs service is convenient and worth enduring to see the splendour of Etna. Just bring good earplugs. And avoid eye contact with the guide.","Mount Etna - AST bus from Catania, cable car and trek to 2900m"
"Last month, September 2005, we (two couples from Israel) stayed for one week in Taormina which is a beautiful town with breathtaking views. Since driving is not too easy in this place, we preferred to book the personalized tours with the company SicilyLife. The tours we took with them were the highlight of our vacation.  The trip to Mount Etna is a must, one of the most interesting sites I have ever visited. We also took a trip to neighbouring towns such as Castelmola - a medieval little town with outstanding views, and the town of Savoca where part of the movie The Godfather was filmed.  We also went to the Islands - Lipari and Volcano which, again, are most interseting. I cannot see how we could get to all these places without SicilyLife. Sebastiano, Alessandro and Antonio are excellent guides, they are extremely nice young men, very knowlegeable, gave us a thourough background and explanations about the area, in very good English, and most of all, are friendly, kind, and comply with every wish. We intend to visit Sicily again, and no doubt will book our tours with them.",loved every minute
"In April 2005, our group of 10 people took a tour of MT. Etna and surrounds with Sicily Life.  We highly recommend their company, everything worked on time and with great service. , ,Here are three photos -- of a Mt. Etna view that day, one of the craters we visited, and also a picture of the restaurant where we had a wonderful lunch.  In addition to lunch and Mr. Etna, we  visited a winery and saw some amazing lava flow areas (including houses buried in lava) from both older and more  recent eruptions.  Another reason to go with Sicily Life is to avoid at least one day driving on your own, just relax and let them do the driving and commentary.  That should be a very welcome relief from driving in Sicily!  The can also do other kinds of tours, which we would have done with more time there., ,Thanks again to Sicily Life!",Great tour from Sicily Life
"We've been to Sicily several times and typically choose to explore independently, but on our September trip, we arranged for a private tour of Mt Etna through a local tour company, Sicilylife. Sicilylife is run by a couple of extremely knowledgeable and charming locals, and our Etna tour proved to be a highlight of our vacation. We were picked up at our hotel (Villa Ducale) by Alessandro, with whom we spent the day exploring Etna (amazing!) and the surrounding villages by way of the area's ""red wine route."" Our tour of the area also included a stop and tasting at the Murgo winery (one of Sicily's best known producers) -- a real treat. There is no better way to get ""inside"" a region than to do so with a native, and our entire day was guided beautifully by Alessandro. We highly recommend Sicilylife for Etna tours, as well as for many other local activities.",Great Tour of Etna with Sicilylife (Local Tour Company)
"We took the gondola which goes almost to the top, amazing views toward the coast.  Hint... before you pay extra (20 something Euros each) for the jeep ride to the very top, ask the people getting off if they could see anything. The day we went, the top was in the clouds and the volcano was inactive. Instead we hiked one of the cones. The restaurant where the gondola lands was very good.",Surreal Etna
"If you are in good condition, you can climb the mount Etna on your own. We are two adults and two children aging 13 and 11 and we did not feel like spending all the money on cable lift and jeeps as prices are high. We parked our car at Refugio Sapienza, which is at 1900 m height. Just before you enter the parking you have a small bar. At that bar there is a path (quite large) which you can walk up (not very steep). The path goes around the cable lifts. When you arrive at the cable lifts you are already at 2500 m height. Then you can follow the same path as the jeeps follow to go up to 2900 meter. This is another 1.5 hour walk. We did not go up at 2900 meter, but it is workable to do this. It was really a great walk with very nice views. We did this walk beginning of april and we had the luck to have a sunny day. We brought a whole trolley of warm vests for the etna, but finally we did not need them. I can imagine though that you would need them if the weather is not sunny.",walk mount etna on your own
"We stayed at Nicolosi 25 k's from Mt Etna. It took about half an hour to get to the parking place. We choose to go as early in the morning as possible and that was an advantage since it became more and more cloudy later on. We parked at the entrance from where the cable car was running. This cost us 27 Euros pp. After arriving to the place  we were not planning to catch the 4WD bus/jeep to the top, because it cost too much, I think another 25 euros. We were just about to walk around and enjoy the view. ,But we started out walking a few hundred meters just to get the feeling how it was like to walk at 2500 meters altitude. After that we walked a little more. We are 65+ so we rested a lot and in the end it was steeper so the lava stones  kept rolling under our feet. After another ridge we were at the peak, almost 3000 m above sea level. That was surely an award: to walk around the ridge of the crater and look down into the smoking hole. (There had been four eruptions earlier this year but not from this hole.) ,Bring WARM clothes if you end up walking! It's so much colder at this height. And bring wind proof clothing if you have! And don't forget something to eat and OF COURSE water!,The view and the experience was worth all the efforts!,By the way, it took us about 1,5 hours to climb, but we saw young people almost running to the top :)",Stunning
"Mt Etna is of course a ""must visit"", but be warned : we were in Taormina for 3 days in October 2005, and even did the Circumetnea railway from Catania and a private tour up the volcano BUT it was totally shrouded in cloud so we didn't even get a glimpse.  A friend was there in June and had the same experience.  It's worth checking with your tour guide that you'll actually be able to see something.... ;0)",Watch out for the clouds...
